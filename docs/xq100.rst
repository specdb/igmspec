This document describes the XQ-100 dataset.

Sources
=======

The XQ-100 survey is a Large Programme and public spectral data release of
100 quasars observed with the X-SHOOTER spectrometer on the VLT telescope.
The full Data Release became available in 2016, as described in
`Lopez et al. (2016) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160708776L>`_.


Meta Data
=========

The meta data provided with XQ-100 follows from Table A.3 of
Lopez et al (2016).  We refer the reader to that paper for
full details.


Spectra
=======

In igmspec v2.0 are all of the combined spectra released in
XQ-100 except the 3-arm stitched products.  That is, each
spectrum is from an individual camera of X-SHOOTER.
This includes the continuum that was ingested in the ESO archive.
