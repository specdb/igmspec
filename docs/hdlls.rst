This document describes the HD-LLS dataset.

Sources
=======

The high dispersion Lyman Limit System (HD-LLS) sample is a set of
echelle and echellette spectra from the Keck and Magellan
observatories acquired by
`Prochaska et al. (2015) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJS..221....2P>`_
for the analysis of z~3 LLS.
The quasars are a heterogenous set of sources useful
for such analysis (ie. bright).


Meta Data
=========

The meta data provided with HD-LLS also includes information on the
LLS analyzed:

============ ======== =========================================
Key          Type     Description
============ ======== =========================================
Z_LLS        float    Absorption redshift of the LLS
log_NHI      float    log10 of the HI column density
sig(log_NHI) float(2) log10 of the HI column density uncertainty (lower/upper)
============ ======== =========================================


Spectra
=======

These are the DR1 data release of HD-LLS.
