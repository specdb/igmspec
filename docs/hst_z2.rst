This document describes the HST_z2 dataset.

Sources
=======

The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) + Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)
Survey for Lyman Limit Systems
is a set of slitless UV/optical quasar spectra obtained with HST/ACS and
HST/WFC3 by
`O'Meara et al. (2011) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..195...16O>`_
for the analysis of z<2 LLS.
The quasars are a homogeneous set of sources from the SDSS with
zem ~ 2 to 2.5 and are bright in the *g*-band.


Meta Data
=========

The meta data provides only the default information.


Spectra
=======

These are the wavelength and flux calibrated spectra using
only Beam A from the observations. See
`O'Meara et al. (2011) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..195...16O>`_
for full details.  The data are written in flambda units
(erg/s/cm^2/Ang) with a 1e-17 scaling.
