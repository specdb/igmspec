GGG Dataset

This document describes the GGG dataset.

Sources
=======

The Giant Gemini GMOS (GGG) survey is a spectroscopic
survey of z>4.4 quasars drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey and re-observed with the GMOS spectrometer on the
Gemini North and South telescopes.  The data release is
described in
`Worseck et al. (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.445.1745W>`_.


Meta Data
=========

The meta data provided with the GGG survey include a considerable
set of data related to the SDSS survey.
It also includes the redshift measurements on these quasars
as described by
`Worseck et al. (2014) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.445.1745W>`_.

Spectra
=======

igmspec v02 includes all of the spectra released in the GGG
survey.  These are flux calibrated, as by Worseck et al. (2014).
Relative fluxes should be accurate but the absolute scaling
may have significant error (>10%).
Every quasar was observed with GMOS using
both the R400 and B600 gratings.
